DECOUPLE

Model Interfaces Needed to Compile:

CollageModel, CollageModelState

CollageModel implements CollageModelState so it is necessary 
for the two to be implemented together. CollageModel is required
because the Features interface requires a Model to reference so
that the model can be fully decoupled from the view.

Pixel

Pixel is referenced in many of the controller utils as many of 
these involve rendering images, requiring grids of pixels. 

Model Classes Needed to Compile:

RGBPixel

The only reason that this is a class and not included in the
Pixel interface is that this contains a convenience constructor
which is very useful for creating grids of pixels as these pixels
need to be instantiated which becomes complicated using a pixel
interface.

PPMUtil

This class is a particularly useful model class for reading and
writing PPM files. It allows the controller to create images 
that are displayable by the view GUI implementation. It is,
similar to RGBPixel, only required by the controller utils and 
thus is used sparingly by the controller at all.


View Interfaces Needed to Compile:

CollageView, ImageCollageView

CollageView is required by the Features interface as it requires
a view to reference to, similarly to CollageModel and 
CollageModelState being referenced by Features, to decouple the
view from the model. ImageCollageView is referenced by the 
FeaturesController class so it is necessary for implementation 
there.
